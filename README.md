## ðŸ”Ž About the Project
The **Library API** is a library management system developed in .NET 8. The API aims to enable the registration, management, and control of books, authors, categories, and loans in a simple and efficient way. The system is designed to facilitate both internal library management and public catalog access.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Registration and management of **books**, **authors**, and **categories**;
- Recording and control of **loans** and **returns**;
- Book availability inquiries;
- **RabbitMQ** notification system for important events, such as pending returns;
- **Structured logs** with Serilog to facilitate monitoring and diagnostics;
- Automated tests with **NUnit** to ensure code quality.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **.NET 8** - Main framework for API development;
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for object mapping and database access;
- **MySQL** - Relational database for information storage;
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for asynchronous communication between services;
- **Serilog** - Logging library for monitoring and debugging;
- **OpenAPI (Swagger)** - Interactive API documentation;
- **Docker** - For containerizing the application and supporting services;
- **NUnit** - Framework for creating unit and integration tests.
