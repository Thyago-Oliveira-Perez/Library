# ðŸ“– Library API

## ðŸ”Ž About the Project
The **Library API** is a library management system developed in .NET 8. The API aims to enable the registration, management, and control of books, authors, categories, and loans in a simple and efficient way. The system is designed to facilitate both internal library management and public catalog access.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Registration and management of **books**, **authors**, and **categories**;
- Recording and control of **loans** and **returns**;
- Book availability inquiries;
- **RabbitMQ** notification system for important events, such as pending returns;
- **Structured logs** with Serilog to facilitate monitoring and diagnostics;
- Automated tests with **NUnit** to ensure code quality.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **.NET 8** - Main framework for API development;
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for object mapping and database access;
- **MySQL** - Relational database for information storage;
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for asynchronous communication between services;
- **Serilog** - Logging library for monitoring and debugging;
- **OpenAPI (Swagger)** - Interactive API documentation;
- **Docker** - For containerizing the application and supporting services;
- **NUnit** - Framework for creating unit and integration tests.

## ðŸš« Requirements
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## ðŸš§ How to Download and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-api.git
cd library-api
```

### 2. Configure the Environment
Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured with the environment variables for the database and RabbitMQ.

### 3. Start the Containers with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start:
- The API in .NET 8;
- The MySQL database;
- RabbitMQ with the management dashboard.

### 4. Access the API
